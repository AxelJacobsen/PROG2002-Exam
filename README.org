* Task description
This exam required us to develop a 3d Tetris-like game in which the player has to manouver pieces in a 3d enviroment, and create a "floor" which gets removed when it is completed, such that the player may continue playing.

### State of the game
As the game stands it is left as it was when i delievered the exam, it is kept as a milestone in my development journey.

* Textures:
All textures used are from the video game minecraft as permitted by the proffessor.

* Provided functions:
Most of the functions in globFunc.cpp are functions that our proffessor has provided, though most are altered to suit my program.
